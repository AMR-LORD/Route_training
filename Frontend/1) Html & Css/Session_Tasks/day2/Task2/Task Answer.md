### Answer description 

The following CSS code is used to style a set of cards displayed in a row. Each card contains an image and text, and the layout ensures proper alignment and spacing. Below is a detailed explanation of why each CSS rule is written:

#### `.cards` (Container for the cards)

```css
.cards {
    width: 100%;
    overflow: hidden;
    text-align: center;
}
```

- `width: 100%;` → Ensures that the container takes up the full width of the parent element.
- `overflow: hidden;` → Helps prevent layout issues caused by floating child elements, ensuring that the container properly wraps around its contents.
- `text-align: center;` → Centers inline content inside the container (though it does not directly affect floated elements).

#### `.card` (Individual card elements)

```css
.card {
    width: 30%;
    float: left;
    margin: 1.5%;
    text-align: center;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

- `width: 30%;` → Each card takes approximately one-third of the container’s width, ensuring three cards fit in one row.
- `float: left;` → Aligns the cards horizontally next to each other.
- `margin: 1.5%;` → Adds spacing around each card to prevent them from touching.
- `text-align: center;` → Ensures that any text within the card is centered.
- `box-sizing: border-box;` → Ensures padding and borders are included in the total width calculation, preventing unwanted layout shifts.

#### `.card img` (Styling for images inside the cards)

```css
.card img {
    width: 100%;
    border: 5px solid #000;
}
```

- `width: 100%;` → Makes the image fully responsive within the card, ensuring it stretches to match the card’s width.
- `border: 5px solid #000;` → Adds a black border around the image to enhance visibility.

#### `.cards::after` (Fixing float-related issues)

```css
.cards::after {
    content: "";
    display: block;
    clear: both;
}
```

- `content: "";` → Inserts an empty element after the last floating element.
- `display: block;` → Ensures that the inserted element behaves like a block to affect the layout.
- `clear: both;` → Prevents the container from collapsing by forcing it to wrap around its floating children.
