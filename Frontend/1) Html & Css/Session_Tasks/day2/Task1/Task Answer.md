**Task Answer**

This CSS code is designed to display three images side by side with titles and descriptions below them, using `display: inline-block`. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the code:

### **`.cards` Class**

```css
.cards {
    text-align: center; /* Ensures that the cards are centered inside the container */
}
```

- The `text-align: center;` property makes sure that all `.card` elements inside the `.cards` container are horizontally centered.

---

### **`.card` Class**

```css
.card {
    display: inline-block; /* Allows elements to appear side by side */
    text-align: center; /* Centers the text inside each card */
    width: 31%; /* Defines the width of each card */
    margin: 10px; /* Adds spacing between the cards */
    vertical-align: top; /* Ensures that all cards are aligned at the top */
}
```

- `display: inline-block;` makes sure that the `.card` elements appear next to each other in the same line instead of stacking vertically.
- `text-align: center;` ensures that the text (title and description) within each card is centered.
- `width: 31%;` sets the width of each card to around one-third of the total width while leaving space for margins.
- `margin: 10px;` provides spacing between the cards for better layout.
- `vertical-align: top;` makes sure that all cards align at the top, preventing uneven alignment if one card has more content than the others.

### **`.card img` Class**

```css
.card img {
    width: 100%; /* Makes the image fill the full width of the card */
    border: 5px solid #000; /* Adds a black border around the image */
}
```

- `width: 100%;` ensures that the image takes up the full width of its parent `.card` element.
- `border: 5px solid #000;` applies a black border around each image to make them visually distinct.

---

### **Overall Functionality**

This CSS ensures that:

- Three cards (each containing an image, title, and description) are displayed side by side.
- The layout is responsive within the available width.
- The text is properly aligned below each image.
- The spacing and alignment remain consistent.
